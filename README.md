# Repository of vulnerable codes for educational purposes
This repository exposes a set of vulnerable software applications to various threats. The purpose for providing these exercises is to allow beginners to hone their **hacking** skills by taking a hands-on experience.

The following exercices are currently available:

+ [Buffer overflow exploitation with strncpy](/strncpy-buffer-overflow)
+ [Path variable manipulation attack](/path-injection)

The list will be updated (quite) frequently with new codes that I provide. Feel free to reach out if there is any problem trying any of these exercices.
